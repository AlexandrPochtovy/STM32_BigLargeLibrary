# STM32F1xx_DMA
Simple STM32F1xx DMA processing for all channels. Use it for the following libraries: I2C, SPI, USART.
The library implements stub functions for resetting DMA interrupt flags and a function for restarting DMA channels.
You only need to add these functions to your methods for interacting with DMA channels.
